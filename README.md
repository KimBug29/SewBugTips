# SewBugTips
Looking for a new hobby? Do you have an interest in sewing? Unsure of sewing terminology? You've reached the right place! Sew Bug Tips is a site which provides SEWING 101 information with images, fabric terminology, reference links and sew much more!

While learning how to code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) I was tasked with creating a project to demonstrate my coding skills. I choose to create a site focused on my hobby - sewing! This site is intended to help anyone interested in sewing, but may feel a little intimated by the jargon.

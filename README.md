# SewBugTips
Are you looking for a new hobby? Is sewing something you would like to learn more about but your not sure where to start? You've reached the right place! This website provides SEWING 101 information with images, fabric terminology, reference links and sew much more!

While learning how to code (html, css and JavaScript) I was tasked with building a project to demonstrate my skills. I decided to create a website focused on my hobby - sewing! This site is intended to help anyone interested in sewing, but may feel a little intimated by the jargon.
